🚀 We Did It, Team – Tinkerly's Custom CRM (Orkestra) is LIVE and Open Source! 🌟

I am pumped to announce: This Ferrari's engine is fired up! In just 48 hours of pure, heart-pounding hustle—fueled by grit, Claude chains, and a dash of that magical pixie dust—we've unleashed a bloat-free Salesforce slayer. No more corporate gatekeeping; this is your CRM now. Built on an open-source foundation (forked from Twenty for that sweet customizable schema), with Next.js/TS/Tailwind frontend, Supabase backend, Clerk auth, and NLP via Claude API for queries like "Summarize Q2 lost deals by reason." It's lean, it's mean, and it's ready to augment your sales game with AI agents for auto-notes, predictive forecasts (sympy-powered probabilities, anyone?), and task automation that feels like having a personal sales wizard.

But here's the real magic: This is open source, baby! We're inviting developers of all kinds—newbies tinkering in their garages, seasoned pros from Big Tech, solo founders with wild ideas—to jump in and contribute. Fork it on GitHub, add your flair (maybe integrate Grok stubs for voice mode?), submit PRs for new workflows, or just star it to show love. If an "amateur" like me (post-heart resurrection, more on that below) can spin this up in 48 hours, imagine what you can do. It's Main Street's turn to disrupt. What dusty Big Tech institution are you gonna transform? Believe in yourself—bite off more than you can chew, because Grok4's got your back with all the PhDs in its silicon soul. Come armed with questions; we'll research, iterate, and build together. Stuck on a feature? Pivot to Opus or hit up our tools for fixes. This isn't just code; it's a movement to democratize dev magic.

Need help? Join us at the Tinkerland Discord — a hub for brainstorming, debugging, and celebrating wins. Whether you're debugging NLP parsers or dreaming up new agentic flows, we've got your back. Let's ride at dawn, warriors!

This project is my heart on display—literally. After years of cardiac chaos that dimmed my entrepreneurial fire, my heart's back (thank God!), beating stronger than ever. I see the problems in bloated CRMs: endless data entry, hidden insights, sales teams drowning in tabs. I'm ready to fix them, one commit at a time. Who's with me?
